# Tracking System

- In this project we have used official Google Maps APIs to show Markers of Single or Multiple users, live location of any user, distance between two locations, etc

- As mentioned in the Hackathon assignment on clicking on the Attendence page we land to the page which store users data in a form of list.

- Now beside of each user there is a location symbol, on clicking it we will get the live location of that particular user in Google Map.

- Also there is a feature that we can insert two locations(from source to the destination) Google Map shows the exact distance in Km and expected reaching time.
